<h2 style="font-size: 30px; text-align: center;" >History of Doctors Day</h2>

<p style="font-size: 25px;">The first Doctors Day was observed on March 30, 1933 in Winder, Georgia at the request of Mrs. Eudora B. Almond, wife of Dr. Cha Almond, Barrow County (Georgia) Medical Society, to recognize the many contributions of local physicians. March 30th symbolizes Doctor's Day because on that day in 1842 Crawford W. Long, M.D., a Georgian, became the first physician to use ether anesthesia in surgery to remove a tumor from a patient's neck. The Auxiliary of the Borrow County Medical Society suggested this day could be an "observance demanding some act of kindness, gift, or tribute in remembrance of the doctors. Cards were mailed to physicians and their wives, and flowers were placed on the graves of deceased physicians, including Dr. Long.

Since then, Doctors' Day has been celebrated in many communities across the country by diverse activities that include the donation of medical equipment and furniture to hospitals and nursing homes, delivering meals to the elderly, blood donation drives, health fairs and the awarding of scholarships for studies in the health-related fields. The United States House of Representatives adopted a resolution commemorating Doctors Day on March 30, 1958. In 1990, legislation was introduced into the Untied States House of Representatives and United States Senate to establish a National Doctors Day. Following overwhelming approval by the House and Senates, then-President George Bush signed a resolution designating March 30 as National Doctors' Day. The first National Doctors' Day was celebrated in 1991.</fieldset></p><br>

<h2 style="font-size: 35px;">Doctors are Life savers</h2>
<p style="font-size: 25px">If we did not recognise the importance of doctors before, we are certainly learning just how much they contribute to society, amid the coronavirus pandemic. While we are self-isolating, it is the doctors who are constantly fighting for the lives of people who have been infected with the deadly virus. With the number of infected people on the rise every day and hospitals teeming with hundreds of people, it has never been more important to appreciate the efforts that doctors make to ensure that we sufficiently recover from whatever may be ailing us and continue to remain healthy. Doctors are truly the greatest heroes, of not just the present but of all time. </p><br>

<p style="font-size: 25px;">India celebrates National Doctor's Day on July 1 each year, in honour of the birth and death anniversary of the great physician and the second Chief minister of West Bengal, Dr. Bidhan Chandra Roy. Since then India has grown by leaps and bounds in the medical field, not just to further Dr. B.C. Roy's work but also with new and innovative techniques. This day serves to show gratitude to all those who have selflessly aided us in our time of need and tirelessly worked for the health of their patients by commemorating the greatest representative of these ideals.

Each year National Doctor's day is organised with a theme, last year's being, "Zero tolerance to violence against doctors and clinical establishment". This year's theme is yet to be decided</p></fieldset><br><br>

<p style="font-size: 25px;">Doctor's Day was established by the Government of India in 1991 to be recognised and celebrated every year on July 1 every year in India. Doctor's Day is observed on different dates across the world. In the United States, the day is observed on March 30, in Cuba on December 3 and in Iran on August 23. </p><br>
