If you dispute any charge or amount on any invoice and such dispute cannot be resolved promptly through good faith discussions between us then you shall pay the amounts due under this Agreement less the disputed amount, and we shall proceed in good faith to promptly resolve such disputed amount.

<h2>7.        Confidentiality</h2>

During the term of this Agreement, each party will regard any information provided to it by the other party and designated in writing as proprietary or confidential to be confidential (“Confidential Information”). Confidential Information shall also include information which, to a reasonable person familiar with the disclosing party’s business and the medical industry in which it operates, is of a confidential or proprietary nature.  The receiving party shall hold in confidence, and shall not disclose (or permit or suffer its personnel to disclose) any Confidential Information to any person or entity except to a director, officer, employee, outside consultant, or advisor (collectively “Representatives”) who have a need to know such Confidential Information in the course of the performance of their duties for the receiving party and who are bound by a duty of confidentiality no less protective of the disclosing party’s Confidential Information than this Agreement.  The receiving party and its Representatives shall use such Confidential Information only for the purpose for which it was disclosed and shall not use or exploit such Confidential Information for its own benefit or the benefit of another without the prior written consent of the disclosing party.  Each party accepts responsibility for the actions of its Representatives and shall protect the other party’s Confidential Information in the same manner as it protects its own valuable confidential information, but in no event shall less than reasonable care be used.  A receiving party shall promptly notify the disclosing party upon becoming aware of a breach or threatened breach hereunder, and shall cooperate with any reasonable request of the disclosing party in enforcing its rights.

Information will not be deemed Confidential Information if such information: (i) is known prior to receipt from the disclosing party, without any obligation of confidentiality; (ii) becomes known to the receiving party directly or indirectly from a source other than one having an obligation of confidentiality to the disclosing party; (iii) becomes publicly known or otherwise publicly available, except through a breach of this Agreement; or (iv) is independently developed by the receiving party without use of the disclosing party’s Confidential Information.  The receiving party may disclose Confidential Information pursuant to the requirements of applicable law, legal process or government regulation, provided that it gives the disclosing party reasonable prior written notice to permit the disclosing Party to contest such disclosure, and such disclosure is otherwise limited to the required disclosure.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, both parties acknowledge that any use of the disclosing party’s Confidential Information in a manner inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement may cause the disclosing party irreparable and immediate damage for which remedies other than injunctive relief may be inadequate.  Therefore, both parties agree that, in addition to any other remedy to which the disclosing party may be entitled at law or equity, the disclosing party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions (without the posting of any bond and without proof of actual damages) to restrain such use in addition to other appropriate remedies available under applicable law.
