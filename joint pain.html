<h2>What can cause Joint pain</h2>
<h3>Arthritis</h3>

<p style="font-size: 20px">One of the main cause of Bone/Joint Pain is <b>Arthritis</b></p>
<p>One of the most common causes of joint pain is arthritis. The two main forms of arthritis are osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).</p><br>

<p>According to the American College of Rheumatology, OA is most common in adults over age 40.</p>
<p>It progresses slowly and tends to affect commonly used joints like the:
    <ul>
    	<li>wrists</li>
    	<li>hands</li>
    	<li>hips</li>
    	<li>knees</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>Joint pain due to OA results from a breakdown of the cartilage that serves as a cushion and shock absorber for the joints.</p>

<p>The most common arthritis seen in India is age-related degenerative arthritis which involves degeneration (wear and tear) of cartilage and can affect any joint such as the knee. In Indian females, the average age for the onset of knee problems is 50 years, in Indian males, it is 60 years</p>
<p>Other causes of Joint Pains</p>
<p>Joint pain can be caused by:</p>
<ul>Joint pain can be caused by:

    <li>bursitis, or inflammation of the cushioning pads around joints</li>
    <li>lupus</li>
    <li>gout</li>
    <li>certain infectious diseases, such as mumps, influenza, and hepatitis
    chondromalacia of the patella, or a breakdown of the cartilage in the kneecap
    an injury</li>
    <li>tendinitis, or inflammation of the tendon</li>
    <li>an infection of the bone or joint</li>
    <li>overuse of a joint</li>
    <li>rickets</li>
</ul>

<h2>Medications</h2>

<p>The medications used to treat arthritis vary depending on the type of arthritis. Commonly used arthritis medications include:
<ul>
    <li>Painkillers. These medications help reduce pain, but have no effect on inflammation. An over-the-counter option includes acetaminophen (Tylenol, others).</li><br>

    <li>For more-severe pain, opioids might be prescribed, such as tramadol (Ultram, ConZip), oxycodone (OxyContin, Roxicodone, others) or hydrocodone (Hysingla, Zohydro ER). Opioids act on the central nervous system to relieve pain. When opioids are used for a long time, they may become habit-forming, causing mental or physical dependence.</li><br>

    <li>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). NSAIDs reduce both pain and inflammation. Over-the-counter NSAIDs include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen (Aleve). Some types of NSAIDs are available only by prescription.</li><br>
</ul>
